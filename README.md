This project was realised in order to present the really basics of Data processing and Strategy backtesting. This is a simple project, when it comes to evaluate the performance of a financial strategy, the creator has to justify its efficiency with so much more evidences.
Nevertheless, this project gives a good idea of the Python functions you need to master in order to apply for market finance postions. (OOP, pandas, matplotlib...)

This is an introduction before I go deeper in the maths when it will come to develop pure quantitative strategies.
